            the colours. I code mainly with JavaScript and other web
            technologies like HTML and CSS but I'm also familiar with Python.

            GovRate: Full stack web app where people can rate and review
            Governments. The frontend is React/Redux and the backend is a
            JavaScript/Node.js API using the Express.js framework. For testing,
            Jest is used on the frontend and backend. Cypress is used for
            end-to-end tests on the frontend. For data persistence a MySQL
            database was used. The app is hosted on AWS, with the app running on
            EC2 and the database on the RDS. The code is available
            <a href="https://github.com/jacklowe/govrate" class="link">here</a>
            and the app can be accessed
            <a href="http://govrate.co.uk" class="link">here</a>.

            This site: HTML, CSS and some client-side JavaScript to cycle

            Master's Project: year-long computational and theoretical physics
            research project for my physics degree thesis using Python. Using
            scientific computing and mathematical methods to work on the
            relationship between Anderson localisation and quantum decoherence,
            a problem in quantum physics/solid state physics. I also did an 8
            week internship the summer before working at the department on the
            same project. Part of the code from this project can be viewed

            Other apps: Video app made with a React front-end and a
            Node.js/Express API back-end and MongoDB database. It was made as a
            part of this

            and sending views to the browser from the server rather than the
            JavaScript framework/API approach. The app is deployed

            Heroku.
