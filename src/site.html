            the colours. I write/code mostly with JavaScript and other web

            GovRate: Full stack web app where people can rate and review
            Governments. The front-end uses React/Redux and the back-end is a
            JavaScript/Node.js API using the Express.js web framework. For
            testing, Jest is used across the stack and Cypress is used for
            end-to-end testing on the front-end. For data persistence a MySQL
            database was used. The app is hosted on AWS, with the app on EC2 and
            the database on RDS. The code is available
            <a href="https://github.com/jacklowe/govrate" class="link">here</a>
            and the app can be accessed

            This site: HTML, CSS and some client-side JavaScript to cycle

            Master's Project: year-long computational and theoretical physics
            research project for my physics degree thesis using Python. Using
            scientific computing and mathematical methods to work on the
            relationship between Anderson localisation and quantum decoherence,
            a problem in quantum physics/solid state physics. I also did an 8
            week internship the summer before working at the department on the
            same project. Some of the code from the project can be viewed

            Other apps: Video booking app made with a React front-end and a
            Node.js/Express API back-end and MongoDB database. It was made as a

            <a href="#" class="link">web development course</a> again using
            Express.js and MongoDB but with more MVC approach i.e. using a
